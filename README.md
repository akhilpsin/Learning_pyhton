### [Code 1](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code1.py)
1. Create a list of your favorite food items, the list should have minimum 5 elements.
2. List out the 3rd element in the list.
3. Add additional item to the current list and display the list.
4. Insert an element named tacos at the 3rd index position of the list and print out the list elements.
 
### [Code 2](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code2.py)
1.Using a for-loop and a range function, print "I am a programmer" 5 times.

### [Code 3](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code3.py)
 Create a BMI calculator, BMI which stands for Body Mass Index can be
 calculated using the formula: BMI = (weight in Kg)/(Height in Meters)^2.
 Write python code which can accept the weight and height of a person and
 calculate his BMI.
 note: Make sure to use a function which accepts the height and weight
 values and returns the BMI value.

### [Code 4](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code4.py)
 Write a function which would divide two numbers, design the function in a
 manner that it handles the divide by zero exception.

### [Code 5](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code5.py)
1. Write Python code to open a file named demo.txt and write some
random data into it.
2. Open the file, read the contents and display them as output.
3. Write python code to add additional text to the existing file on a new line
without deleting the previous contents.
For solution refer next lecture.

### [Code 6](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code6.py)
 Write Python code which accepts name of a product and in turn returns
 their respective prices.
 Make sure to use dictionaries to store products and their respective prices.
 The dictionary should include at least 5 elements.

### [Code 7](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code7.py)
 List out all the odd numbers from 1 to 100 using lists in Python.
 
### [Code 8](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code8.py)
 Assume you want to build two functions for discounting products on a 
 website.
 Function number 1 is for student discount which discounts the current price 
 to 10%.
 Function number 2 is for additional discount for regular buyers which 
 discounts an additional 5% on the current student discounted price.
 Depending on the situation, we want to be able to apply both the discounts 
 on the products.
 Design the above two mentioned functions and apply them both 
 simultaneously on the price
 
### [Code 9](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code9.py)
 Calculate the value of mathematical expression x*(x+5)^2 where x= 5 using
 lambda expression.

### [Code 10](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code10.py)
 Using the concept of object oriented programming and inheritance, create
 a super class named Computer, which has two sub classes named Desktop
 and Laptop.
 Define two methods in the Computer class named getspecs and
 displayspecs, to get the specifications and display the specifications of the
 computer.
 You can use any specifications which you want.
 The Desktop class and the Laptop class should have one specification which
 is exclusive to them for example laptop can have weight as a special
 specification.
 Make sure that the sub classes have their own methods to get and display
 their special specification.
 Create an object of laptop/ desktop and make sure to call all the methods
 from the computer class as well as the methods from the own class


### [Code 11](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/code11.py)
 Using the concept of operator overloading in Python, change the behavior
 of the multiplication operator in a way that multiplication operator behaves
 like an addition operator.

## Additional Example questions
### [subsequence](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Learning_pyhton/blob/main/subsequence%20.py)
 Virus Outbreak

 In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person.
 POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?
 If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.
 Example:
 Virus Composition, V = coronavirus
 Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus

 The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V.
 The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the peopleâ€™s current blood composition. Can you help them?

 Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.

 Input Format
 The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V
 The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N
 Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi

 Constraints
 1<= N <=10
 1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5

 Output Format
 For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line.

 Input
 coronavirus
 3
 abcde
 crnas
 onarous

 Output
 NEGATIVE
 POSITIVE
 NEGATIVE
